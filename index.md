I am a Ph.D. holder in Mathematics in Combinatorics and an assitant professor at [**Kotebe University of Education**](https://www.kue.edu.et). I earned my **Ph.D. in Mathematics with Combinatorics Specialization** from Addis Ababa University under the supervision of [Roberto Mantaci](http://www.informatique.univ-paris-diderot.fr/), and the co-supervisions of [Samuel A. Fufa](https://www.aau.edu.et) and [JÃ¶rgen Backelin](https://www.su.se/joeb). As part of my Ph.D. research work, I have also been collaborating with [Per Alexandersson] (https://www.alexandersson.symmetricfunctions.com).
