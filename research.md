My research areas are enumerative and algebraic combinatorics. Specifically, I study the distribution of various statistics on combinatorial objects like set partitions, permutations, and subexcedant functions. Also, I study the structure of different combinatorial objects.

My Ph.D. Dissertation, defended in January 2023, was about some combinatorial results on set partitions and permutations by means of subexcedant functions. My Supervisor was [Roberto Mantaci](http://www.informatique.univ-paris-diderot.fr/), my cosupervisors were [Samuel A. Fufa](https://www.aau.edu.et) and [Jörgen Backelin](https://www.su.se/joeb).
